# Bricks-Breaker-Game
•	Developed a game that most of us played in our childhood. In this game, there is a small ball that hits the bricks with the help of a small paddle present at bottom of the game. With the help of this paddle, a player can revert the ball in a different direction. Breaking more bricks leads to an increase in score. If you miss the ball to hit the paddle then the game will be over.

•	There is a total of 2 levels in this game. If completed the ﬁrst then you will be promoted to 2.

•	Concepts Used: OOPs, Animation, Graphics
•	 IDE Used: IntelliJ.
